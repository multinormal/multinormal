### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a statistician at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)](https://www.fhi.no/en/). I have a PhD in statistical modelling, am a chartered statistician (CStat), and have about 20 years of medical research experience. I perform systematic reviews and health technology assessments (HTAs) for the [Norwegian specialist health service](https://nyemetoder.no), am a statistical editor for [Cochrane's Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group](https://epoc.cochrane.org), support the design and analysis of [randomized controlled trials (RCTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial), and provide statistical training within NIPH and Cochrane and other research centers in Norway, Scandinavia, and globally. My work is a mix of analysis, consulting, and teaching.

Previously, I have worked as a Senor Data Scientist and developed internationally-competetive predictive models of the mammalian immune system for use in developing next generation DNA sequencing-based personalized cancer therapies. Before that I was a Research Fellow at the University of Manchester, where I developed and applied analysis methods for use in imaging-based clinical trials of novel cancer therapies.

You can find a list of my publications at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?hl=en&user=dOMFVvwAAAAJ), and [read my resumÃ© at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/multinormal/).

This GitHub account currently has only a few public repositories for some of the projects I have worked on (unfortunately, most of my code cannot be made public for commerical reasons). Some examples are:

* [DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography)](https://github.com/multinormal/ddsm) â€” Software for obtaining and decoding digital mammograms and annotations of abnormalities from the DDSM's servers at the University of South Florida.
* An R package for the [analysis of a national survey of Norwegians' understanding of key concepts for making informed health choices](https://github.com/multinormal/fhi.informed-health-choices-norway.2019).
* [FuturesKit](https://github.com/multinormal/FuturesKit), a Swift package for writing asynchronous code using [futures and promises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) that allows developers to move asynchronous tasks up into the type system.
