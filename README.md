### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a statistician (PhD, CStat) at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)](https://www.fhi.no/en/) with over 20 years of medical research experience. I work on:

* Meta-analyses for Cochrane systematic reviews and health technology assessments (HTAs) for the [Norwegian specialist health service](https://nyemetoder.no).
* Design and analysis of RCTs.
* Statistical training at NIPH, in Norway and Sweden, and occasionally elsewhere in the world.

Previosuly I worked in academia and industry, and have collaborated on research projects with companies such as AstraZeneca, GSK, Pfizer, and Genentech, mostly focusing on developing analysis methods for use in imaging-based clinical trials of novel cancer therapies.

You can find a list of my publications at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?hl=en&user=dOMFVvwAAAAJ), and [read my resumÃ© at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/multinormal/).
