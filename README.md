### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a statistician (PhD, CStat) at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)](https://www.fhi.no/en/) with over 20 years of medical research experience. I work on:

* Design and analysis of RCTs, with a recent focus on [interventions for controlling epidemics](https://www.fhi.no/en/more/research-centres/ceir/).
* Meta-analysis and health technology assessment (HTA) for the [Norwegian specialist health service](https://nyemetoder.no).
* Statistical training at NIPH, in Norway and Sweden, and occasionally elsewhere in the world.

I'm also a statistical editor for the Cochrane Effectice Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) review group. Previosuly I worked in academia at the University of Manchester and in industry, and have collaborated on research projects with companies such as AstraZeneca, GSK, Pfizer, and Genentech, mostly focusing on developing analysis methods for use in imaging-based clinical trials of novel cancer therapies.
